# Curly
Curly is a multi-threaded task runner for AEM maintenance operations.  It is meant to supplement and/or replace the traditional use of cURL commands.

## Requirements
Java 11 is required to use this utility.  Maven (v3 or higher) is required to build this from source code.  All other dependencies are retrieved automatically by the Maven build process.  Note that a build is platform-specific because it includes platform-specific JavaFX libraries.

## Getting Curly
The 2.0 release is here!   Note that you should download the version specific to which OS you're running.  If you are on Linux, you can build for your platform as well, I just don't ship a build due to low demand.
